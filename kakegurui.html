                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Kakegurui is a gambling anime and follows Yumeko Jabami, who enrolls at Hyakkaou Private Academy, where students are ranked by their gambling winnings, and fame and fortune await those who rise to the top. She is really good at gambling and at ratting out students who cheat. Her skills combined with her observant nature help her to expose a lot of the students at the academy whilst rising to the top.</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>lol this anime is wild... I do like the character designs they are very pretty but in terms of plot and character development... well... its kinda non-existent. The anime is VERY repetitive like every few eps is the same; yumeko gambles, wins, someone gets exposed, their ranking goes down, her ranking goes up, repeat. A lot of people watched this bc of the fan service. If you have a raging passion for women, youd probably enjoy this anime. It does get a little dark and psychotic at times though... rich people things</h3>
