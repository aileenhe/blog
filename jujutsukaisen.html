                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Jujutsu Kaisen is an action/fantasy anime, based off of a manga by the same name. It follows Yuuji Itadori as he enrols in the 'Tokyo Jujustu High School of Sorcery', after eating a cursed finger of Sukuna. Lead by one of the most powerful sorcerers, Satoru Gojo, Itadori must find all the cursed fingers in order to eat them and then exorcise himself to kill the curse... yes</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>This anime is like a mix of demon slayer. naruto and... basically anime dark fantasy action anime... theres a lot... the anime itself is pretty good and gojo is fucking hot so- (and toji but he hasnt appeared in the anime yet) OK ILL STOP- its very interesting to watch and there is comedy sprinkled throughout so it isnt too dark. Its also a good pace, which makes it easier to watch. I would recommend watching it (or what is out rn anyway).</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>hmm probably 3.5/5. its a very good anime so far but has to compete against so many classic dark fantasy action animes. I would definitely rewatch it when the whole things comes out though.</h3>
