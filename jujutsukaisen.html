                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Jujutsu Kaisen is an action/fantasy anime, based off of a manga by the same name. It follows Yuuji Itadori as he enrols in the 'Tokyo Jujustu High School of Sorcery', after eating a cursed finger of Sukuna. Lead by one of the most powerful sorcerers, Satoru Gojo, Itadori must find all the cursed fingers in order to eat them and then exorcise himself to kill the curse... yes</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>This anime is like a mix of demon slayer. naruto and... basically anime dark fantasy action anime... theres a lot... the anime itself is pretty good and gojo is really hot so- (and toji but he hasnt appeared in the anime yet) OK ILL STOP- its very interesting to watch and there is comedy sprinkled throughout so it isnt too dark. Its also a good pace (well it starts kinda slow but thats ok), which makes it easier to watch. I would recommend watching it (im waiting for s2 tho like pls).</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>hmm probably 3.5/5. its a very good anime so far but has to compete against so many classic dark fantasy action animes. I would definitely rewatch it when the whole things comes out though. its also kinda slow to start and itadori *sometimes* annoys me.</h3>
                 <h2> Movie Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Jujutsu Kaisen 0 is an action/fantasy anime movie, and its a prequel to the anime. it follows this guy names yuuta (what is it with them naming the mcs basically the same thing) and he has this fat curse who is his dead girlfriend from when he was like... 8... uhm yes. anywho he enrolls in tokyo jujutsu high and meets maki inumaki and panda and they r all first years and yea gojo is hot geto is hot every one is very cool and op.</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>ok i surprinsingly liked this better than the anime, probably bc none of the characters were annoying and it was very intense so there werent any boring parts like there was always action so it was fast paced which i like. also when gojo changes from the sunglasses to the bandage DAYUMM anywho. yes very good i liked very much um i was kinda confused tho cus yuuta kinda doesnt exist in the anime but that was answered with an after credits scene that gojo looked very good in ok goodbye.</h3>
