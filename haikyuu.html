                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Haikyuu!! is a sport/comedy anime based on the manga of the same name. It follows Hinata, Kageyama and the rest of the Karasuno volleyball team as they train together in hopes of winning the national championship.</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>Ok this anime is pretty good. the characters are all very different and you can see their personalities really clearly. its a very light-hearted bright anime whilst still managing to have some more serious scenes/eps sprinkled throughout. There is quite a lot fo character development, espeically with hinata and kageyama (i mean, they are the main characters...) One thing i dont like abt the anime is how it can sometimes be repetitive.</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>hmmm probably 3.5/5. the anime is really fun to watch and you wont get tooo stressed (besides light every time the compete... which is like every few eps...). i personally dont think i would watch it again but i would read the manga</h3>
