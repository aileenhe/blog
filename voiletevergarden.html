                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Voilet Evergarden is a drama/emotional anime... movie.. theres like a seaon of anime, a movie and two specials i think. It follows Voilet Evergarden, who fought in the war. Due to her age when she became a soldier, she has become detached and emotionless. She becomes an auto-memory-doll and writes letters for others whilst discovering her own emotions.</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>yoooooo this anime is actually really good. The graphics are really really pretty its drawn so well. the story is really good as well, it gets you sad and happy and yea its really good. I would recommend watching it at least once. the plot has twists and turns and its not as predictable as you would think. ahhh i really enjoyed watching it, it wasnt stressful just more emotional :)</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>hmmm probably around 4/5. the anime is so good but sometimes i felt like it dragged on a bit and some of voilet's decisions in the movie were a bit questionable...</h3>
