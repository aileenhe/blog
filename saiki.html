                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Saiki K is a comedy/supernatural anime. Its about Saiki Kusuo, a highschool student with super powers (hi, I am Saiki Kusuo and I have psychic powers. iykyk) He tries to keep these powers a secret and live a normal life but his QUIRKY classmates make this hard. He also finds himself in a lot of tight situations (usually due to said quirky classmates) and has to eventually use his psychic powers to get out of said situations.</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>oml i shouldnt like this anime so much but i do. its so funny and light hearted and saiki is literally done with everyone and everything. all the characters are really lovable (except maybe teruhasi, she annoys me but a lot of ppl like her so...). saiki also breaks the fourth wall and talks to the audience a lot so its pretty funny. some of his lines are also iconic (yare yare... COFFEE JELLY) and yea its just really fun to watch.</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>Solid 4/5. the one thing i didnt like so much about it was how annoying it sometimes was to watch, either the characters or the situation saiki is in.</h3>
