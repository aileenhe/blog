                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Banana Fish is a crime fiction/thriller anime. Ash Lynx is a seventeen-year-old gang member in New York (gang gang woo... his description kinda sounds like one of those cringey as wattpaad fanfics...) and Eiji Okumura is a nineteen-year-old Japanese photographer's assisstant, who goes to New York to help document New York's underground and young teen gangs for a magazine. Ash is on a quest (homie b a man on a mission) to find out more about the 'banana fish' drug, which affected his brother. coincidentally, he meets this dude in an alleyway who dies in front of him after giving him this vial and says 'banana fish' (wow such a natural coincidence will definitely happen irl). anywho yea thats abt it ash tries to find what banana fish is and meets eiji.</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>yooooo this anime is actually pretty good. theres a shit ton of kidnapping and escaping and trading of people and killing (i mean mafia stuff yk). ash is so cool (and fucking hot thank you very much). eiji *sometimes* annoyed me but thats ok. it was kinda sad at the end (even for me) but i was mentally prepared bc so many ppl spoiled it for me (*EHMM SO RUDE EHMMM*). I think you definitely have to watch more than once to see the little intricate details that makes it even sadder (is that a word? eh). some scenes were rlly out of nowhere (ep 3 wtf man just gets... bruh what... and then they-). the storyline is pretty basic, its what youd expect when you think gangs and mafia and stuff, but its still a rlly good anime. the character development is good and ash is rlly hot ok bye. would recommend go watch. </h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>hmmmmmmmm 4/5 bc ash is hot (otherwise it wouldve been like a 3.5) and its very detailed amd its sad (even for I) so its good.</h3>
