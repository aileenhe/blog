                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>oml this anime was so funny. its so janky but thats why i actually like it. The main character, Tatsu, looks so tough on the outside but in reality hes just a simp for his wife and obsessed with grocery shopping. The characters and plot are both really simple but its a really entertaining and light anime. my home button is from this anime :></h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>hmmmmmmm 3.5/5. its a really good filler anime but the eps were a bit janky. i think thats the style it was going for though.</h3>
