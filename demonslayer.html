                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Demon Slayer is an action/adventure anime based off of a manga. It follows Tanjiro as he trains to become a demon slayer and eventually goes on missions with his sister Nezuko and best buds boar dude rawr (inosuke) and french frie pikachu boi (Zenitsu). He decides to become a demon slayer after some major life changing events (bruh its so hard to expalin what happens without giving spoilers.) Season 1 is followed by a movie (Mugen Train arc) which came out in 2021 and season 2 is being uploaded right now (jan 2022).</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>Demon Slayer is pretty good. The opening of s1 is iconic, a very screech worthy song mmhm mmhm. I think i watched the whole of s1 in one day bc i was at a swimming carnival and there was nothing better to do LMFAO. The show is sometimes pretty heavy but it makes up for it bc there are a lot of funny and light-hearted bits (especially the first few eps of s2 its pretty funny). s1 did get a bit repetitve towards the end as he just fought, got a bit injured, won, repeat. BUT mugen train was rlly good season 2 has been really intersting so far (based on the 7 eps that are out). 90% of s2's budget went to drawing tiddies so if ur into that.. uh go ahead :) o and demon slayer is rated ma 15+ for animated violence so just a heads up :)</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>i think its a solid 4/5. you should definitely watch it at least once and it is very popular. The only bit thats not as grerat is the repetitiveness towards the end of s1.</h3>
