                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>ok this anime was pretty good. The characters are all very cute (espeically the infants their faces were literally OwO) and the plot was very well written. The op is really good and so is isabella's lullaby. I liked how there were twists in the plot that you wouldn't expect and how each character had their own role to play. It was very interesting to watch.</h3>
