                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                <h3>"A whisker away" is a romance/fantasy anime movie about a young girl called Miyo. she likes her classmate Kento and with the help of a really fat tabby cat, she getse a mask that lets her become a cat, which helps her get closer to Kento... as a cat...? look it sounds really weird but its pretty good.</h3>
                <h2>Review</h2>
                <h3>I really enjoyed this movie. its a very good feel good movie to watch between more dramatic animes. The plot of the story probably sounds hella weird written in words but once you watch it, it makes a lot more sense. Its a very cute movie with really really pretty visuals, like desktop background worthy. Sometimes, you might cringe a bit at the second hand embarrassment but yk, thats ok! its one of those animes that you wouldnt watch many times, but once in awhile you'll watch it again and still be entranced. yea its pre good go watch.</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>i would give this movie a solid 3/5, ik it seems kinda low but there are better animes out there, i enjoyed it a lot and im sorry if this is your fave!!</h3>
