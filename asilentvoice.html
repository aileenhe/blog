                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>"A Silent Voice" is a romance/drama anime movie, adapted from a manga by the same name. Basically, it's about this guy called "Shoya Ishida" who bullies his classmate, "Shouko Nishimiya" as she has a hearing problem, causing her to transfer schools. Years later, Ishida's life isnt that great bc of karma. He meets Nishimiya again and then it just goes on a story abt how Ishida and Nishimiya stop hating themselves.</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>Ok this movie was kind of disappointing if i am totally honest. I watched it bc it was meant to be sad, but I did not connect with the characters enough to feel this sadness so I didnt enjoy it. It reminds me of those 'enemies to lovers/bully gets redeemed to lovers' tropes. The ueno girl also pissed me off a LOT i absolutely hated her not a fan. i think the trailer is a lot better than the actual anime. There was a lot of character development though and the visuals and music were very nice. the suspense whe Ishida fell into the water also helped with the atmosphere, so the movie does have redeeming points.</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>hmmm i think this movie is probably a 1.5/5. it was good the first time, i will not be watching it again thank you.</h3>
