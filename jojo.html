                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is an adventure/fantasy anime that follows a family destined to fight supernatural foes who bring destruction. Each season goes through at least one generation of Jojos, who are all really strong and powerful because they have a lot of energy and each generation learns special 'stands' from the previous to increase their power.</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>Ok Jojo's is a mix of lighthearted and heavy. Its really interesting to see how the different Jojos fight and their different personalities, even though they all use the same basics. The art style is also really unique and the character designs are really good. I would recommend you watching it at least once. Some of the characters are really powerful and cool and the fight scenes are done really well.</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>hmmm probably around 3.5/5 because the plot and characters are pretty basic and what you would expect from a adventure/fantasy anime/</h3>
