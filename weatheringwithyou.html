                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>bruh the graphics are so good. its such a pretty anime and the music is also really good. the plot is pretty basic like theres nothing very strange abt it and the characters are all developed quite well. my only problem is the ending of the anime like bruh is it really that easy to get her back?</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>hmmm probably 4/5. its a really really good anime and i think i would definitely rewatch it. the ending is just a bit iffy tho</h3>
