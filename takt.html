                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Takt Op. Destiny is a music/science fiction/action anime. It is made by Mappa/Madhouse so the graphics are really fucking good. Its set in 2047, where music cannot be played freely bc then these monster things called 'D2s' will attack you. these monster thingos came from a black meteorite that decided to yeet into the earth six years ago and they dont vibe to human music, so they try to destroy it. Takt Asahina is obsessed with playing music and along with Cossette/Destiny and Anna, they join this organisation called 'Symphonica International Organization'. Using Musicarts (these really weird splatoon lookin ass people who are basically human weapons, we love that), they defend the cities from D2s.</h3>

                 <h3>3.5 based purely on how hot takt is ok the plot is pretty basic and so are the characters but the character designs are really really good (especially takt's)</h3>
