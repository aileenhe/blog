                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Your Lie in April is a romance/drama anime based off of a manga. It  follows Arima Kousei, a skilled pianist. However, he hasn't played since he played for his mother who died a few years ago. He meets Kaori, a free spirited violinist, who slowly adds colour to his world and helps him rediscover piano (weow so poetic)</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>ok i had really high expectation for this anime because of everything ive heard about it and i was kinda disappointed. it wasnt as emotional as i had expected but the plot and characters are really well written. i loved the friendship dynamics between the characters. i think i didnt enjoy it as much i couldve because people spoiled it for me.</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>hmmm 2/5. idk sad animes arent really my thing after trying a few, i couldnt get attached to the characters enough to feel sad, but im pretty sure thats my problem. the op (hikaru nara) is iconic tho</h3>
