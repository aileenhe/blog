                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>To Your Eternity is a fantasy anime based off of a manga. It is about an immortal being, Fushi, who can change forms when stimulted (as in, when it feels heavy emotions). It makes friends and enemies and slowly learns what it means to become human.</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>this was... disappointing. I was told that this anime could make you cry in the first episode. i, in fact, did not cry. The rest of the anime was pretty mediocre as well. There was like a small arc every few eps so it is pretty fast paced. the only problem is how the anime is a bit repetitive and predictable.</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>I think its a 2/5. i personally didnt enjoy it because i didnt really get attached to any of the characters so i wasnt sad when sad things happened. i was also kinda glad when one of the characters stopped appearing. there are some 'disturbing' scenes tho so be warned :)</h3>
