                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Tokyp Ghoul is a dark fantasy/thriller anime. It follows Kaneki Ken as he goes from innocent lil nerd boi, to hot half demon dude, to pure lookin white haired bro, back to hot half demon dude. yea it basically follows him as he gets captured, escapes, gets captured again, escapes, repeat.</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>Ok this was my first anime series so it hold a special place in my heart. the first season is really good but it goes downhill fromm there so.... the characters are really well developed and the plot gets a bit iffy at times but it is really good in the end. I would recommend reading the manga, watching s1 and then skipping to season 3.</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>hmmm 3/5. season 1 got me pretty hooked but the rest of them werent great. i recommend reading the manga (its a lot better). o and its also considered 'gorey' (by friends who have proper standards on what is/isnt gorey :D)</h3>
