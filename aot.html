                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>AHHHHHHHHHH AOT GOT ME FEELING SUM KINDA WAY I LOVE IT SO MUCH WOOOOO (i need to calm tf down but im telling you aot is so good oml). "Attack on Titan" is an action anime based off of isayama's manga that currently 4 season long (i watched the whole thing in 5 days just needed to flex that) and is being completed this year (2022). Apparently after s4 p2 comes out theres gonna b a movie wrapping the series up. Its abt EREN YAEGER (JAEGER) (bruh everytime i see his name i have to say if in the deep voice anywho) fighting for freedom. I wont spoil it go watch it its really good. o and just as a heads up, a lot of people found aot a little gorey (i personally didnt but my standards of gorey are a bit messed up...) so if you dont like gore, watch at your own risk.</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>ok this is probably one of the best animes i have watched it is easily in my top three. There is so much character development (i mean its four seasons if there wasnt any it wouldnt be so popular...) and its very action packed and fast paced, something i like in anime (not a fan of slowburn kinda drags and gets boring). I actually got attatched to the characters and i will be very sad when this anime ends, big sage. After i finished what is out so far, i was depressed for a solid three days listening to akuma no ko (s4p2 ending). anyway its a masterpiece the plot the characters everything. i havent found any plotholes yet but towards the end, you see a lot of parallels with the start and it really comes a full circle, which i like in animes, all those little easter eggs you can find ahh. Its also an anime you could probably rewatch twenty times and still find new details, it is so intricate i sometimes wonder how much planning went into this seried brother it is *cheff's kiss*</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>ok i would give this a 5/5 but since i dont believe in the perfect anime its a 4.99/5. all seasons are really good, which is kinda rare. anywho go binge it rn this is an order (oh and after u finish it if u need someone to rant to hmu)</h3>
