                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Yarichin B*tch CLub is... a good ol' yaoi anime, based off of a manga. Only 2 eps were animated though. Takashi T≈çno has just transferred to a new school, Morimori Academy, a private college prep boarding high school located deep in the mountains. After arriving, he decides to join some clubs and chooses the 'photography club'... um... this was in fact, not a photography club =D</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>Ok this is probably the most questionable anime i have watched. the content is questionable the characters morals are questionable with whole thins is just a massive ????. its only two eps though so its a short watch and the op (touch you) is... iconic? idk if thats the right word for it but uh. hmm. um watch it if ur into that kinda stuff i mean it is labelled as a yaoi so... if yk what that is and ur into that go ahead</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>im.... not gonna rate this anime bc i feel like ill get attacked either way so uhh... you can make your own judgements :D</h3>
