                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Millionaire Detective is a mystery anime about Kmabe Daisuke, a millionaire detective, and Kato Haru, a normal detective. Although they have different thoughts on the value of people's lives, they must work together to fight the city's crimes.</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>ok if i am honest, there are so many plot holes, sometimes it feels like you've skipped an episode, sometimes the way the crime is solved makes zero sense, but that's ok BECAUSE DAISUKE IS SO FUCKING HOT LIKE HE'S RICH TOO?? MAN MARRY ME PLEASE I DEFINITELY LIKE YOU BECAUSE OF YOUR KIND AND CARING PERSONALITY DEFINITELY NOT BECAUSE YOU ARE RICH AND HOT NOPE MMHM</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>i would give this like a 3/5 (the 3 coming from how funny it is and how much i actually enjoyed watching it) but since daisuke is hot i think its deserves at least a 3.5/5 ;) </h3>
