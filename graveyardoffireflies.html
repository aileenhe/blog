                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Grave of the Fireflies is a war/drama anime movie that follows siblings Seita, who is fourteen, and his little sister Setsuko, who is four. After losing everything due to the war, Seita and Setsuko have to go live with their aunt, who belittles them and treats them unfairly. And so, they leave their aunt's place. They rely completely on one another to survive.</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>I had really high expectations for this movie as it is a ghibli. I was not disappointed but... it also did not reach my expectations. I had heard about how sad it was and I agree, it is really really really sad, but i expected balling my eyes out sad, which did not happen. The movie really showcased the destruction of war, especially the impact it had on children who were left without their family's. I think the movie becomes sadder after you realise how realistic it depicted war and the impact the bombings had on Japan.</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>I think this movie is a solid 4/5. It's very raw in terms of showcasing the reality of war, I just couldn't seem to be devasted by what happens to the characters... i think thats more my problem though. Definitely worth watching, rewatch value is also really high, dont watch if you cant deal with really sad animes :')</h3>
