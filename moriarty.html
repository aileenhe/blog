                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Moriarty the Patriot is a murder mystery anime. It follows William James Moriarty, an orphan who along with his younger brother, was adopted by the Moriarty Family. Due to his hatred for corrupt British nobles (the thing is set in late 19th century britain btw), he uses illegal means (i.e. killing ppl) to slowly abolish the social class system.</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>oml i actually loved this anime. there was a lot of murdering so if u cant do 'gore' dont watch. Moriarty is kinda hot ngl and he was psychotic, my favaourite type of anime boy <3.the anime revereced a ton of other ppl like holmes, james bond (i think idk ive never watched the movies) and jack the ripper. its rlly good you should watch it at least once i reckon.</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                <h3>solid 4.5/5 i rlly enjoyed it and i dont think its that famous so it do b like a little gem woo. it was recommended to me by someone who has literally the same taste in anime as me so that worked out pretty well :D</h3>
