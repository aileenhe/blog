                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>ok i watched this movie because i had to study it for school so to say i enjoyed it a lot would be a fat stretch. its a good movie with a lot of good morals and stuff but it is kinda intense. i wouldnt call the visuals pretty but it is drawn really really well. the music is also pretty good. the plot and character development is really good like you can clearly tell each character's personality and goals etc.</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>i give a 2.5/5. although the character development and plot was good, i didnt really enjoy watching it, partly because i had to watch it for english and partly because i found the plot kinda basic for a ghibli.</h3>
