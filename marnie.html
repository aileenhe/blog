                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>weow this was such a pretty anime. I really enjoyed watching it. the characters were really well developed like you could tell their personalities and their fears and stuff. The plot was mainly well planned out but after wathcing it, i had to google an explanation because my small brain couldnt comprehend some of it :)</h3>
