                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>"Cells at Work" is a biology/comedy anime based off of a manga (by the same name). It follows 'Red Blood Cell' as she works in the human body, fighting viruses, diseases and a shit ton of other illnesses (like damn how dis human not dead yet home boy has it tough). It's very informative and educational and i got away with watching it in science saying i was 'watching an educational show on the human body'.</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>Ok this anime saved my science mark. If ur doing a biology unit in science WATCH THIS SHOW. Its very informative whilst being funny and all the character designs are hella cute (the platelets oml my heart). It also gives some of the characters backstories (I wont say who bc that will spoil it) and follows a plot so its not like a animated documentary. I think this is one of those animes that you watch once and then never again due to its nature and genre.</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>i think this is a 2/5  because I wouldnt have watched it unless i was into bio. you cant really rewatch it but it is a good anime to watch if ur learning abt the human body in school</h3>
