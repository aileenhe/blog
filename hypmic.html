                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Hypnosis Mic is a rap battle anime about these four rap teams that use their music to fight evil?? ok so basically they are in this world where people can get hypnotised if they listen to the sound that comes out of a 'hypnosis mic'... wow you would've guessed. so yea the four teams are actually trying to win the rap division but they team up to defeat sum bad guys and kick sum ass anyway-</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>Ok if i am completely honest the rapping in hypnosis mic is trash... BUT THE CHARACTERS ARE REALLY HOT anywho moving on- umm. the visuals are quite cool when they rap but the plot is pretty predictable and repetitive... look honestly i was just there for the hot looking characters ok dont judge...</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>hmmm 2/5. i wouldnt watch the whole thing again but i would watch it to stare at the characters ANYWAY- :)</h3>
