                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>"Arrietty" is a fantasy anime movie. Arrietty and her parents are really little people living in the walls of a mansion. The family 'borrows' (steals) goods from the family living in the mansion to survive. One day, Arriety gets caught by the actual people living in the mansion and so the story starts.</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>for me, this movie was eh. i think my standards were a bit high though as it was a ghibli movie. the plot was a bit disappointing but the visuals werent (thank god). you could probably get some scenes for desktop backgrounds (why is this my way of determining if visuals are good or not...) I didn't really enjoy the ending (I won't spoil it hehe) and I feel like the story doesn't really go anywhere and is quite predictable. Putting the plot aside, the character developement was really good, especially with Arriety (i mean, she is the main character...) but you cant really see what type of person each character is. </h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>hmmmm this one is hard to rate..hmmm probably around 2.5/5. i think the graphics really saved it but honestly the plot itself was a bit iffy. its a very good movie to watch with friends and family tho!</h3>
