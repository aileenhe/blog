                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>OMFG HOWL IS SO HOT I CANNOT HE IS SDAL;IHAERLKGHAE;KGRHA;EKRJGHA;KJEFHG;ALSKFJDA;SLDKFJA;FGH anywho. Howl's Moving Castle is my comfort anime and probably my favourite anime movie/ghibli film. the graphics are AMAZING they are really pretty i have so many desktop backgrounds from this movie. and merry-go-round of life is a masterpiece and it fits the movie so well. althgough the plot is a bit weird and confusing, the movie (*emm howl EEHMM*) is still charming nonetheless. ive watched this movie over 15 times in the past two yrs so yea it rlly is my comfort anime :D </h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>Solid 4.99/5 (i dont think theres such thing as a perfect anime, like obviously everything has bits more improvement but howl's moving castle is pretty close) it really is a beautiful movie go watch it</h3>
