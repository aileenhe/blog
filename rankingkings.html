                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Ranking of Kings is a fantasy adventure anime based off of a manga by the same name. Bojji, a little prince, who is very weak. He was born abnormally small, weak, and deaf and is unable to properly wield a normal sword and can be injured easily. He goes on an adventure trying to become the best king he can. His main goal is to conquer his insecurities and fears.</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>ahhhhhhh this anime is so cute T^T. The art style is more cartoonish but the plot sometimes gets really intense. You really wanna protect Bojji as he goes on his journey so you'll hate some characters a lot, but you'll also feel really sorry for some of them. The anime isn't fully out yet (s2p2 is coming out later this year i believe) but what's out so far is really eye catching. would recommend</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>hmmm 3.5/5. I enjoyed this anime so i would recommend wathcing it at least once. The character design is really really cute and it really controls the audience's emotions really well. I just didnt really like how plot of the story went towards the end.</h3>
