                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Your Name is a romance/fantasy movie. Two teenagers, Mitsuha Miyamizu and Taki Tachibana share a spiritual connection (wow actual soulmates) and swap bodies. One day, they suddenly stop swapping bodies and realise that the lives of hundreds of people are in their hands.</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>wowowowowow this is such a pretty anime i love. Their dynamic is pretty funny like they keep trying to set each other up with dates. I also really liked the body-swapping montage and the little sister, shes so funny. I would definitely recommend watching this movie more than once.</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>solid 4.5/5. the music and visuals are so pretty and the plot actually kinda makes sense even though its so confusing. Its really stressful tho so if u cant do stressful anime, probably just watch it once.</h3>
