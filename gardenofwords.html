                 <h2>Overview & Recap</h2>
                 <h3>Garden of Words is romance/drama anime movie. It is about this high school kid Takao, who is fifteen. Mans really likes rain so he goes to this garden place one day because mans not bothered to go to school and decides to skip (wish i could do that but fear of the parentals holds me back... btw man doesnt have parents i think). He meets this lady person and starts to develop feelings for her o.0 so speedy. Anywho, they decide to meet at the garden place anytime it rains... oh and btw the garden place is sheltered its kinda like this little picnic area in a garden yk?</h3>
                 <h2>Review</h2>
                 <h3>ok so the 'movie' is 45 mins so its rlly quick and short, which made the pacing a bit... hmm... it somehow fit the events of three months into 45 mins but i feel like so much happens and it goes from 0-100 real quick. yk how in your name theres like a montage of their daily lives where its like flashes of their lives and its around halfway through the thing, well this movie also had one but it was in the first i wanna say like ten twenty minutes, which is also like halfway but it seemed so much quicker bc of how short the movie is. anywho, theres this weird scene were the guy just admires the girl's feet... it was consensual tho. their age gap is also really questionable like mans in high school and lady is well into her years (not like eighty like nearly thirty). Their relationship dynamic kinda got weird towards the end when... discoveries about their identities were made... I quite like it tho it was kinda wholesom? but the ending was very abrupt and nothing get solved... well... it gets solved but it was like a ...??? kinda ending yk?</h3>
                 <h2>Rating</h2>
                 <h3>hmmmmm 3.5/5 because i actually really enjoyed watching it and it was very relaxing. The visuals and music are so good omfg like hs desktop background worthy very nice very nice mmhm mmhm. their relationship was wholesome but kinda weird... i dont think i would watch it again unless i was introducing it to somehow... anywho it is still wortha watch tho gogo</h3>
